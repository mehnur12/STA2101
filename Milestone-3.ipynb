        "Looking at the table and the charts, Cancer comes up as the most common medical condition in this group of patients, followed by Diabetes and Arthritis. Conditions such as obesity and asthma have noticeably fewer cases. When all frequencies are compared side by side in the bar chart, there is a clear peak in Cancer, but there is not a single category that stands out as an outlier; all the numbers are spread within a reasonable range.\n",
        "The frequency polygon shows a sharp increase and then a gradual drop-off, while the cumulative frequency (ogive) increases in steady steps, which means there is no sudden jump or unusual gap; the numbers simply build up over the categories. The pie chart also puts Cancer at the largest slice, but every medical condition holds a visible portion, showing the data set is not dominated by just one or two issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conclusion:\n",
        "From these data, it is clear that some conditions are more common than others, but the overall spread is balanced with no extreme values at either end. Cancer, Diabetes, and Arthritis have slightly higher counts, creating a mild peak, but the distribution does not show a heavy skewness or any major outlier. Therefore, the data set shows moderate variation and a natural range between medical conditions. This suggests a fairly typical set of patient medical frequencies, without the condition being excessively rare or overwhelmingly common.\n",
